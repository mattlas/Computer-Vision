# Tree Markup Toolbox

A method for positioning field measured trees relative to image data for building a 3D model. 

First the area is flown with the drone and images are acquired. These images are processed (stitched) in to an image mosaic, that mosaic is then used by
the field personal to position the tree that is measured. Positioning is done by marking the measured tree
in the mosaic. Back in the office, the stereophotogrammetric processing of the images into a 3D model
is done and then the relative position of the tree measurement can be connected to the right tree in the
3D model.
