Summary changelog file for release.

Release 0.6.2.1, Mar 30, 2017.
- Bugfix to handle Photoscan .ply files with no size info.
- Autocalibration now defaults to f, cx, cy, K1-K3, P1-P2 if the camera was
  optimized in Photoscan.

Release 0.6.2.0, Mar 10, 2017.
- Added functions to analyze and plot a .psz project.
- Added automatic column scaling of the Jacobian to reduce numeric warnings.
- Improved performance for posterior OP variance computation.
- Can now work with .psz projects with a mix of enabled/disabled control points.
- Can now load .psz project without any transform.
- Added explanation of how to run self-calibration postprocessing of Photoscan
  project (see ps_postproc.m).

Release 0.6.1.0, Dec 15, 2016.
- Cleaned up the id handling in the Photoscan loader. Now, the images 
  (cameras) in the .psz projects can have any ids. Previously, the camera ids
  were assumed to be 0, 1, ...
- Fixed bug that assumed that all unreconstructed mark points in a .psz
  project had a ray count of 1.

Release 0.6.0.0, Dec 1, 2016.
- Added support for post-processing of Photoscan .psz projects. This includes:
  - Post-processing in fixed camera mode without lens distortion.
  - Post-processing in auto-calibration mode with lens distortion using the
    Photomodeler lens distortion model.
  - Post-processing may be performed in global coordinates or semi-local
    coordinates (same translation and scaling used by Photoscan, but no
    rotation). The latter reduces the condition number of the design matrix.
- Added progressbar to loadpsz for long load times.
- Added logarithmic autoscaling to lens distortion parameter plotting.
- Expanded OP ray count and OP high correlation info in report file.
- Enabled processing in semilocal coordinate system (translate, scale, but
  not rotate).
- Various bugfixes related to Photoscan project loading.

Release 0.5.1.6, Oct 18, 2016.
- Various bugfixes.
- Fixed code issues in xchg dir due to Windows handling of links.
- Fixed PhotoModeler table loading bug due to end-of-file issue in Windows.
- Fixed several PhotoScan loading issues.
  - Can now load any chunk of multi-chunk file.
  - Improved loading tolerance (i.e. does not crash) towards single/multiple 
    instances of projections, sensors, etc.
  - Now uses PhotoScan default values for control point std and mark
    point std.
  - Now handles object/mark point #0 by shifting all IDs with 1.
- Fixed a weighting issue for PhotoScan projects. Previously, the high
  weights (low std) that should be associated with the control point
  image measurements in all images were given to the first points in
  the first image.

Release 0.5.1.5, Aug 11, 2016.
- Added lo-res images for the ROMA, CAM, SXB data sets to the repo with 
  instructions on how to download  hi-res images.
- Added plotting of measured point on images to many demos.
- Cleaned up some unused code.

Release 0.5.1.4, Jul 11, 2016.
