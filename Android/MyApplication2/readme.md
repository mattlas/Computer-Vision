# TreemApp

TreemApp is a mobile application where the goal is to help foresters when they're out working with the help of a flying drone to take pictures from above.

## Getting Started

It is recommended after cloning the repository to open the android project in Android Studio.

Hence that before starting with the android application it is important to also understand what the desktop application does and how the communication is done between the two.

### Prerequisites & Dependencies

The mobile app is built with Android Studio with:

* **Minimum SDK version**: 22
* **Target SDK version**: 25
* **Gradle version**: 2.3.2

All dependencies are found under *app/build.gradle*.

### Installing

1. Install Android Studio.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Open the Android project in Android Studio.
4. Sync Gradle to install dependencies.
5. Done! Ready to run the application.

### Testing

JUnit tests are found in *app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/treemapp* and *app/src/test/java/com/example/treemapp*. Run tests by opening the folder and running the app in Android Studio.
