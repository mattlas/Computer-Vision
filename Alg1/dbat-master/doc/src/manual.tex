\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}

This purpose of the Damped Bundle Adjustment toolbox is to be a
high-level toolbox for photogrammetry in general and bundle adjustment
in particular. It is the hope of the authors that the high-level
nature of the code will inspire algorithm development. The code is
written in Matlab and is verified to work with Matlab version 8.6
(release R2015b). The intention is that at least the computation
routines will be Octave-compatible. This has however not been tested
yet.

\subsection{Contents}

\subsubsection{Code}
The toolbox currently includes routines for (Matlab function names within parentheses):
\begin{itemize}
\item File handling:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Reading PhotoModeler-style text export files (\texttt{loadpm}), 
    and 2D/3D point table exports files (\texttt{loadpm2dtbl} and
    \texttt{loadpm3dtbl}, respectively).
  \item Reading PhotoScan native (.psz) files (\texttt{loadpsz}).
  \item Writing PhotoModeler-style text result files
    (\texttt{bundle\_result\_file}).
  \end{itemize}
\item Post-processing:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Post-processing of PhotoScan projects
    (\texttt{ps\_postproc}). Includes object point filtering on low
    ray count and low intersection angles. \textbf{For
      self-calibration post-processing, see the help text for
      \texttt{ps\_postproc}.}
  \end{itemize}
\item Photogrammetric calculations, including:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Spatial resection (\texttt{resect}).
  \item Forward intersection (\texttt{forwintersect}).
  \item Relative orientation based on the Nist{\'e}r 5-point algorithm
    \citep{Stewenius2006:Recent} will be added in the future.
  \end{itemize}
\item Bundle adjustment
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Bundle adjustment proper (\texttt{bundle}), with or without
    self-calibration, using either Classical Gauss-Markov,
    Gauss-Newton-Armijo, Levenberg-Marquardt, or
    Levenberg-Marquardt-Powell damping schemes
    \citep{Borlin2013:Bundle,Borlin2014:Camera,Borlin2016:External}.
  \item Covariance calculations (\texttt{bundle\_cov}) from the bundle
    result.
  \end{itemize}
\item Various plotting functions, including:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Plot image covered by measurements
    (\texttt{plotcoverage}).
  \item Plot camera network (\texttt{plotnetwork}), either static
    (as-loaded) or as an illustration of the bundle iterations.
  \item Plot .psz project (\texttt{loadplotpsz}).
  \item Plot of the iteration trace of parameters estimated by bundle
    (\texttt{plotparams}).
  \item Plots of quality statistics from the bundle result
    (\texttt{plotimagestats, plotopstats}).
  \end{itemize}
\item Demo functions using the above functions. The demo functions are
  detailed in Section~\ref{sec:demos}. The available demos are listed
  by executing the command \texttt{help dbatdemos}.
\end{itemize}

This manual does not contain detailed information about how to use
each function. More information may be found by typing \texttt{help
  <function name>} at the Matlab prompt, studying the source code of
the demo functions, and reading the source code of each file directly.

\subsubsection{Data}

The toolbox contains several datasets, including datasets for the
\citet{Borlin2016:External} paper.
\begin{itemize}
\item PhotoModeler export files or PhotoScan projects.
\item Images. To reduce the size of the distribution package, only low
  resolution images are included in the package. The corresponding
  high resolution images can be downloaded from
  \url{http://www.cs.umu.se/~niclas/dbat_images}. Further instructions
  are found in \texttt{README.txt} files in the respective image
  directories.
\end{itemize}
The simplest way to access the data sets is through the demos,
described in Section~\ref{sec:demos}.

\subsection{Legal}

The licence detail are described in the \texttt{LICENSE.txt} file
included in the distribution. In summary:
\begin{itemize}
\item You use the code at your own risk.
\item You may use the code for any purpose, including commercial, as
  long as you give due credit. Specifically, if you use the code, or

\section{Usage}

\subsection{Demos}
\label{sec:demos}

\textbf{Hint: You may wish to use the command \texttt{close all}
  between the demos to close all windows.}

\subsubsection{Plotting}
\label{sec:loadplotdemo}
\label{sec:loadroma}

The \verb+loadplotdemo+ function load and plots the content of a
PhotoModeler text export file. Two examples are included in the
toolbox: {\sc Roma} and {\sc Cam}.

\paragraph{\sc Roma}
\verb+loadplotdemo('roma')+ loads a modified PhotoModeler text export
file of the 60-camera, 26000-point project used
in~\citet{Borlin2013:Bundle}. The camera network, as computed by
PhotoModeler, is plotted with camera 1 aligned to the cardinal axes.
The result should look like Figure~\ref{fig:roma}. The figure is a
standard Matlab 3D figure and may e.g.\ be rotated or zoomed using the
camera toolbar.

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\hsize]{ill/roma}
  \caption{The figure generated by the \texttt{loadplotdemo} demo.}
  \label{fig:roma}
\end{figure*}

\paragraph{\sc Cam}
\label{sec:camcaldata}
\verb+loadplotdemo('cam')+ demo loads a modified PhotoModeler text
export file of a 21-camera, 100-point camera calibration project. The
camera network, as computed by PhotoModeler, is plotted and should
look like Figure~\ref{fig:camcalib}. The figure is a standard Matlab
3D figure and may e.g.\ be rotated or zoomed using the camera toolbar.

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\hsize]{ill/ccam}
  \caption{The figure generated by the \texttt{loadplotdemo2} demo.}
  \label{fig:camcalib}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Camera calibration}

The \verb+camcaldemo+ demo loads the camera calibration export file
from Section~\ref{sec:camcaldata} and runs a camera calibration. The
EXIF focal length is used as the initial value. The other values are
set to ``default'' values, e.g.\ the principal point at the center of
the sensor and all lens distortion parameters equal to zero. The
initial value for the EO parameters are computed by spatial
resection~\citep[Chap.~11.1.3.4]{Haralick1994:Review,McGlone2004:Manual} using
the control points defined for the PhotoModeler calibration sheet. The
initial OP coordinates are subsequently computed by forward
intersection.

The bundle adjustment is run with Gauss-Newton-Armijo damping
\citep{Borlin2013:Bundle}. The result is given in a number of plot
windows and a Photo\-modeler-style result text file. The result plots
are of two kinds: Plots that show the evolution of the iterations and
plots that show the quality of the input or output data. The former
plots may be useful to understand how the bundle adjustment works but
also to ``debug'' a difficult network that has convergence
difficulties. The latter plots give information about the quality of
the result and may also provide clues on how to improve a network when
the bundle did converge.

\paragraph{Evolution plots}

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.7\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ill/ccamx0}
    \caption{Initial network configuration.}
    \label{fig:camx0}
  \end{subfigure}%

  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.7\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ill/ccamxfinal}
    \caption{Network configuration after convergence, with camera
      center trace lines.}
    \label{fig:camxfinal}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{3D network evolution during the iterations. Only the EO and
    OP parameters are illustrated. In this example, the variation of
    the OP coordinates is barely visible. }\label{fig:net3DTrace}
\end{figure*}

The evolution plots are collected in
figures~\ref{fig:net3DTrace}--\ref{fig:gnatrace}.
Figure~\ref{fig:net3DTrace} shows a snapshot of the 3D trace figure at
the beginning and end of the iterations. As default, the evolution is
presented iteration by iteration with intervening presses of the
return key. The figure window is interactive and may be rotated,
zoomed, etc. In this example, it is clear in
Figure~\ref{fig:camxfinal} that one camera station had poorer initial
values than the rest.

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{ill/ccamiotrace}
  \caption{Evolution of IO parameters during the iteration sequence.}
  \label{fig:IOtrace}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{ill/ccameotrace}
  \caption{Evolution of EO parameters during the iteration sequence.}
  \label{fig:EOtrace}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{ill/ccamoptrace}
    \caption{Evolution of OP coordinates during the iteration
      sequence.}
    \label{fig:OPtrace}
\end{figure*}

Figures~\ref{fig:IOtrace}--\ref{fig:OPtrace} contain three plots
showing the evolution of the internal orientation (IO), external
orientation (EO), and object point (OP), respectively, during the
iterations. The IO plot is split into a focal/principal point panel
and a radial and tangential distortion panel, where the radial
distortion parameters are scaled to provide more information. The EO
plot contains a camera center panel and an $\omega$-$\phi$-$\kappa$
Euler angle panel. The EO and OP plots are interactive. Lines in the
plots or legends may be selected and all corresponding lines will be
highlighted. In the top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:EOtrace}, the motion
of one camera stands out. Clicking that line reveals that it belongs
to camera station~21, which can be further investigated to decide if
it should be excluded from the calibration.

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{ill/ccamgnatrace}
  \caption{Residual evolution and damping behaviour during the
    iterations.}
  \label{fig:gnatrace}
\end{figure*}

The final evolution plot, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gnatrace},
illustrates the evolution of the norm of the total residual and the
damping behaviour, if any, during the bundle iterations. In this
example, the Gauss-Newton-Armijo linesearch damping is active during
the first two iterations. For further details on the damping,
see~\citet{Borlin2013:Bundle}.

\paragraph{Quality plots}

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{ill/ccamcoverage}
  \caption{Plots of input/output statistics: Image coverage.}
  \label{fig:ccamCoverage}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{ill/ccamimstats}
  \caption{Plots of input/output statistics: Image statistics.}
  \label{fig:ccamImstats}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{ill/ccamopstats}
  \caption{Plots of input/output statistics: Object point statistics.}
  \label{fig:ccamOPstats}
\end{figure*}

The quality plots a gathered in
figures~\ref{fig:ccamCoverage}--\ref{fig:ccamOPstats}. Per-image
quality statistics is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ccamImstats}. The
statistics presented for each image are the image coverage
(rectangular coverage, convex hull coverage, and radial coverage); the
number of measured points; the average (RMS) point residual; and the
standard deviations for the EO parameters for the camera stations. In
this example, the data does not give any obvious support to exclude
the suspected image~21 from the calibration.

The image coverage is detailed in a separate
Figure~\ref{fig:ccamCoverage}. The plotted data is selectable. All
observations from a specific image, including their convex hull, will
be highlighted when a point or line is selected.

Finally, the per-OP quality statistics in Figure~\ref{fig:ccamOPstats}
show the number of observations per OP; the maximum ray intersection
angle; the average (RMS) point residual; and the OP coordinate
standard deviation. The presentation may be zoomed to show only a
subset of the OPs by activating the ``zoom'' function of the figure
window.

\paragraph{Result file}

The result file is modelled after the PhotoModeler result file.
The result file is listed in Appendix~\ref{sec:resultFile}.

\subsubsection{Bundle adjustment}

\paragraph{\sc Roma}
The \texttt{romabundledemo} function loads the project from
Section~\ref{sec:loadroma} and present essentially the same plots and
the \texttt{camcaldemo}. This demo uses the PhotoModeler file as input
to the bundle adjustment that runs a few iterations until convergence.
The same result file and result plots as \texttt{camcaldemo} are
essentially generated. Since the project is larger (60 cams/26~000
points) than the previous example (20 cams/100 points), the
computation will take a bit longer. Computation time was around one
minute running on a HP compaq dc7800 with an Intel Core2 Quad CPU
Q9300 @ 2.50GHz under 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 (kernel 3.5.0-45).

\paragraph{\sc Prague'16}
The \texttt{prague2016\_pm} function displays six projects that
compare the result of the bundle adjustment procedure in DBAT and the
results of PhotoModeler \citep{Borlin2016:External}. Similarily, the
\texttt{prague2016\_ps} function displays the results of a comparison
between DBAT and PhotoScan.

The v0.5.1.6 release includes a fix to a bug the distributed the image
observation weights incorrectly. The result is slightly different
estimation results than in \citet{Borlin2016:External}. However, the
conclusions remain valid.

\subsection{Using your own data}

This section describes how to import you own data using PhotoModeler
text export files. If you have another type of input file, you may be
able to write your own loader. Otherwise, if you have a text file you
wish to import, feel free to mail the file to the the toolbox authors
and request an import function. Althought we cannot guarantee
anything, we may adhere to the request, time permitting.

\subsubsection{Export from PhotoModeler}

To import a PhotoModeler project into the toolbox, the following
steps are valid in PhotoModeler Scanner 2012:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Export the project using the \emph{Export Text File} menu
  command. If the command is not available, follow the instructions in
  Appendix~\ref{sec:enableTextExport}.
\item After export, open the \emph{Project/Cameras...} dialog and
  select the camera that was used in your project.
\item Open the generated text file in a text editor.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item On the 2nd line (usually reading \texttt{0.00005 20}), append
    the width and height in pixels of your images, e.g. to
    \texttt{0.000500 20 5616 3744}.
  \item Inspect the 4th line. For instance,
    the original data in \texttt{roma.txt} was (some trailing zeros removed):

    \texttt{24.3581 18.1143 12.0 35.96404 24.0 0.00022 -0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0}

    The values correspond to the following camera parameters:

    \texttt{focal pp\_x pp\_y format\_w format\_h K1 K2 K3 P1 P2}.

    Notice that most of the significant digits of K1--K3 were lost in
    the text export.
  \item Update the parameter values on the 4th line with values from
    the camera dialog \emph{for each parameter with a larger number of
      significant digits in the dialog}. This usually means all
    parameters except \texttt{format\_w}. In the \texttt{roma.txt}
    test case, the 4th line was modified to:

    \texttt{24.3581 18.1143 12 35.96404 24 2.174e-4 -1.518e-7 0 0 0}.

  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Loading into Matlab}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In Matlab, run step~\ref{step:dbatInit} from
  Section~\ref{sec:install} if not already done.
\item Call \texttt{loadplotdemo} with the name of your text export
  file as first parameter. A figure with your camera network, aligned
  with the first camera and rotated to have +Z 'up', should now have
  been generated.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Using the bundle adjustment of DBAT}

Modify either of the demo functions to match what you want to do. If
you run into any problems, send us an email. The interesting results
may either be in the plots or in the result file.

\subsection{Enabling text export from PhotoModeler}
\label{sec:enableTextExport}.

Some versions of PhotoModeler do not have the text file export option
enabled by default. In that case, the following steps worked in
PhotoModeler Scanner 2012:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Right-click on the main window toolbar, select \emph{Customize toolbar...}.
\item In the \emph{Commands} tab, select the \emph{File} category.
\item Drag the \emph{Export Text File...} command to a toolbar of
  your choice.
\item Now you should be able to export your project as a text file by
  clicking on the \emph{Export Text File} button.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Camera model}

Currently, the only supported camera model is the omega-phi-kappa
Euler angle camera model \citep[Ch.~2.1.2.3]{McGlone2004:Manual} with
the \citet{Brown1971:Close-range} lens distortion model.
