MATCHING SOFTWARE
-----------------

The 'match' program performs stereo matching using a number of standard 
algorithms.

The program is called as follows:

  match [-d min_disparity max_disparity] 
        [-m SAD | SSD | NCC | ZSAD | ZSSD | ZNCC | RANK | CENSUS] 
        [-w window_size] 
        [-t tx_window_size] 
        <base-file> 
        <outputfile>

Optional Arguments
------------------

[-d min_disparity max_disparity]  
Disparity range used to search for a match, Defaults to [0 100].

[-m SAD | SSD | NCC | ZSAD | ZSSD | ZNCC | RANK | CENSUS] 
Matching algorithm to use.  Defaults to SAD.

[-w window_size] 
Window size to use for matching.  A square window is always used.
This should be an odd number so that the pixel being matched is 
at the centre of the window.  Defaults to 11.

[-t tx_window_size] 
Used only if the matching algorithm is set to RANK or CENSUS.  This
is the window size used to perform the rank or census transform.
Defaults to 5.


Required Arguments
------------------

<base-file> 
The name of the files containing the left and right images in pgm
format.  The suffixes '-l.pgm' and '-r.pgm' are added on to the 
specified base file name.

It is also assumed the input stereo pair is epipolar.

<outputfile>
The name of the output file which the disparity map resulting from
the matching process is saved as.  The suffix '.pgm' is added onto
the specified file name, and the disparity map is saved in pgm
format.

Examples of Use
---------------

match -m NCC -d 0 40 -w 5 rock rockNCC

This matches the stereo pair rock-l.pgm and rock-r.pgm using the
NCC algorithm, a match window of 5 and a disparity search range 
of 0-40.  The disparity results are stored in the file rockNCC.pgm.

match -m RANK -t 5 -m 11 rock rockRANK

This matches the stereo pair rock-l.pgm and rock-r.pgm using the
RANK method, using a rank transform window of 5 and a match window
of 11.  The results are stored in rockRANK.pgm.
